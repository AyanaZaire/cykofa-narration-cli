      "content": "Working with nature to alleviate the threat of ‘Data Warming’, Grow Your Own Cloud creates a new materiality around data. We imagine a world in which data storage absorbs CO2. Where data can be shared through pollination. Where a data centre could grow data in your backyard. Through this research work, we look to propose alternatives to the current systems of storage, processing and monetizing of data. Currently ownership of our data is largely under the realms of large corporations (GAFA) who store the data in enormous facilities far flung from the location of the initial user. We seek to establish a new type of cloud that offers a more tangible and intimate relationship with data. A cloud that encourages people to take care of their data. A climate first approach to the development of new data storage technologies which promote regenerative futures. To do this, we work with a new type of Data Science, using the oldest storage device in the universe - DNA.",

In them days, they farm three months, then when the lay-by time come—’round the last of May, June—they go to piecing quilts. August, go back to the field. October and November, up into December—and then after Christmas and New Year over with—back to piecing and quilting. Piece by yourself; quilt together. When you go to quilt, you beat the cotton out on the floor, first thing, to get the dust out. Then sweep the floor—collect the cotton—spread the lining out and put the cotton back on the lining, beat it out, put the top on there, get your thread and needles and hook it in the quilting frame.",

      "content": "Funk is everlasting life. Nothing ever dies in funk. Okay you take an apple tree, and if nobody picks that apple, that apple is going fall to the ground. And it’s going to decompose and it’s going to go back into the soil and that’s when it gets its funkiest, its most fertile, is when its decomposing. Cause that’s when that seed inside that apple starts germinating and going into another tree. That’s its funkiest, that’s its richest life. So when you get to your funkiest, really that’s your richest time, you know? That’s where music, poetry, visions to help you get out of that hell. If you’re paying attention, it comes. That’s the most fertile time of your life but you have to really know how to direct that whole energy. Cause when plants or anything starts decomposing, even our feces, I mean that’s rich. You can purify water with charcoal cow manure. It’s a very rich state but it can kill you too. You need to know how to work with it, it’ll take you down and take you under. But it’ll revive you too.",

      "content": "Still, for me, that was the least important aspect of the work. Because, no matter how \"fictional\" the account of these writers, or how much it was a product of invention, the act of imagination is bound up with memory. You know, they straightened out the Mississippi River in places, to make room for houses and livable acreage. Occasionally the river floods these places. \"Floods\" is the word they use, but in fact it is not flooding; it is remembering. Remembering where it used to be. All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was. Writers are like that: remembering where we were, what valley we ran through, what the banks were like, the light that was there and the route back to our original place. It is emotional memory - what the nerves and the skin remember as well as how it appeared. And a rush of imagination is our \"flooding.\\",

      "content": "And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical. In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain. And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy: divination through the earth. This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390. Leibniz, the German mathematician, talked about geomancy in his dissertation called \"De Combinatoria.\" And he said, \"Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes, let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two.\" Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code. George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra, and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer. So all these little PDAs and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa. And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers, but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno. (Laughter) (Applause)",

      "content": "So now I want to talk about the science. How were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating? Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allelochemicals and hormones -- information. And you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved. Mycorrhiza literally means fungus root. You see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest. They're the mushrooms. The mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg, because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium, and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants. And where the fungal cells interact with the root cells, there's a trade of carbon for nutrients, and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle. The web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single footstep. And not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest, individuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir, and it works kind of like the Internet.",
